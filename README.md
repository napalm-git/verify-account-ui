# A functional Ui component for account verification.

This project contains a few bit of javascript compared to many other projects i have here.

My main goal was to sort of mimic those websites where when you try to login to their website they sent your email a 6 digit code that you need to enter on the website in order to login.

I feel as though in a way i accomplished that goal by adding a verification alert box after entering so called 6 digit code to the field.

I used couple different colors in the Ui itself mainly whiteish and blueish very light blue or very dark blue colors.

And the font was the Mule font from google fonts.
